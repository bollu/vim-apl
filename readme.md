This has been forked from [`git@gitlab.com:n9n/vim-apl.git`](https://gitlab.com/n9n/vim-apl).

## Features

- rainbow curly braces with a matching colour for `⍺`, `⍵`, `∇`, and `:`
- use backquote as a prefix key, e.g. ``` `i ``` for `⍳`, ``` `r ``` for `⍴`
  (configurable through `g:apl_prefix_key`).
- `<c-x><c-u>` completion for quad names, keywords, and system commands.
